## 📘 Introduction
The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is a unified platform designed to automate and optimize HR processes. It eliminates manual work, reduces paperwork, and provides real-time HR insights using a secure, scalable architecture.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Reduce manual errors and paperwork  
- Improve efficiency in HR operations  
- Provide real-time insights to HR, employees, and leadership  
- Enable employee self-service  
- Ensure compliance with audit requirements  
- Build a secure and scalable architecture

## ❗ Problem Statement
Traditional HR systems struggle due to:
- Dependence on spreadsheets and outdated tools  
- Manual processing of attendance, leave, payroll & recruitment
